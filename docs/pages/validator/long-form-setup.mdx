# Running Your Own RPC


Run your own RPC by building and deploying the docker image provided here: https://github.com/interstate-labs/proposer-commitment-network/tree/main/interstate-gateway

We also provide help charts to do so here: https://github.com/interstate-labs/proposer-commitment-network/tree/main/kubernetes

You need to set the .env file, and can also run from cargo source. When pointing relays ensure the relays you point to follow the constraints api: https://github.com/eth-fabric/constraints-specs.

We suggest pinging us on on telegram for guided help: [![Chat](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?color=neon&logo=telegram&label=chat&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftg.sumanjay.workers.dev%2F%2BPcs9bykxK3BiMzk5)]([https://t.me/+Pcs9bykxK3BiMzk5](https://t.me/+-i4dP7U2BggxMzAx))
