Set your commit-boost or mev-boost relay to Interstate's endpoint. Set Interstate as the *only* relay.

1. Point MEV-Boost or Commit-Boost to the relay endpoint above. Make sure you set only one relay endpoint, the relay above. Interstate is an rpc that submits constraints to relays.
      - Your request follows this path: commit/mev-boost --> rpc --> relay
      - You can run the RPC yourself if you would like to configure which relays to use. Any [constraints-api](https://github.com/eth-fabric/constraints-specs) compatible relay works.

List of Relays that Interstate uses:

| Network | Constraints-Api-Compatible-Relay-Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Helder | https://helder-relay.interstate.so | 
| Mainnet | https://mainnet-relay.interstate.so | 
| Mainnet | https://bloxroute.max-profit.blxrbdn.com |
| Hoodi | https://hoodi-relay.interstate.so|



Coming soon: Aestus, Ultrasound Relay, Titan-Relay, and more.
