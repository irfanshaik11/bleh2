Registering for slashing insurance allows users to slash if their preconfirmation is missed and increases the chances of a user signing up for preconfirmations. Certain users may only send preconfirmations if the slash insurance for a certain slot exceeds a certain amount. Interstate can provide slashing collateral on your behalf, please reach out to inquire!
